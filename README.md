Review of basics (html, git + cli)

In this project I am creating a simple webpage to review some skills with html, git & 
using using the command line. I am practicing using different html elements and attributes 
to display a barebones site.

I want to work on building some muscle memory with various web dev tasks. I was feeling a 
little out of practice. So while I am job hunting I am going to continue to hone these skills.
